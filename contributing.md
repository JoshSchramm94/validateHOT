## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct]().

## Getting Started

Contributions can be made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines cover both:

- Before creating your own Issue, please carefully look through the existing one to check whether your Issue is already adressed.
- We try to address issues as soon as possible. However, depending on the problem and maintainer availability, it could take a while to investigate the problem. In case an issue has not received any attention for a while, please send a friendly reminder. 

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. 
Please provide exemplarily code to when reporting the bug to better understand the problem. 

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. However, please always open an Issue before submitting a PR.

In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.


In general, we follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) development model:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
