# validateHOT &#127919;

The goal of validateHOT is to validate the results of your validation task (also known as holdout task). A validation task is essential to make sure that your collected data of a *MaxDiff*, *CBC*, or *ACBC* are valid and can also predict outside task that were **not** included in estimating your utility scores. At the moment, validateHOT provides the following functions: 

<ul>
<li>
`createHOT`: creates the validation/holdout task for you. For example, in a *CBC* the total utilities are calculated by the sum of each attribute level. You have to specify the attribute levels for each alternative in the validation/holdout task and it will calculate the total utility for each alternative in the validation/holdout task.
</li>
<li>
`accuracy`: generates the number of correct predicted choice or no-choice divided by the total number of predictions. Only possible for a binary output, e.g., buy vs. no-buy correctly predicted.
</li>
<li>
`f1`: generates the F1-Score. F1-Score is calculated by the following formula $\frac{2 * precision * recall}{precision + recall}$. Only possible for a binary output, e.g., buy vs. no-buy correctly predicted.

## Installation

You can install the development version of validateHOT from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JoshSchramm94/validateHOT")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:



You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
