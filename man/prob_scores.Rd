\description{
Function to calculate probability scores for (anchored) MaxDiff
}
\details{
\code{prob_scores} converts raw utilities of a MaxDiff to probability scores.
Probability scores for the unanchored MaxDiff are calculated according to the formula provided by
Chrzan & Orme (2019, p. 56): \eqn{\frac{e^U}{(e^U + (a - 1)}}, where \emph{U} is the
raw utility of the item and \emph{a} is the number of items shown per choice task.

For anchored MaxDiff the following formula is applied \eqn{\frac{e^U}{(e^U + (a - 1)} * 100 / (1 / a)}
(Chrzan & Orme, 2019, pp. 59-60).

\code{data} has to be a data frame with the attributes. Items have
to be the raw utilities.

\code{group} optional grouping variable, if results should be displayed by
different groups. Has to be column name of variables in \code{data}.

\code{items} specifies the items of the MaxDiff.
Input for \code{items} has to be variable names.

\code{set.size} specifies the size of the choice sets (how many items were
shown in one task). Input needs to be a whole number.

\code{res} specifies whether results should be aggregated across all participants
or across \code{group} (\code{res} needs to be set to \code{agg}) or if it scores
should be converted for individuals only

\code{anchor} only needs to be specified if anchored MaxDiff is applied. Input
