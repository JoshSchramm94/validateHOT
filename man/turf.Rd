\usage{
turf(
  data,
  opts,
  none,
  size,
  fixed = NULL,
  prohib = NULL,
  approach = c("thres", "fc")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with all relevant variables.}

\item{opts}{Column names of the alternatives included in the assortment.}

\item{none}{Column name of none / threshold alternative.}

\item{size}{A numeric vector to determine size of the assortment.}

\item{fixed}{An optional vector to determine alternatives that have to be
included in the assortment.}

\item{prohib}{An optional vector to determine prohibitions, i.e.,
alternatives that are not allowed to be together in one assortment.}

\item{approach}{A character whether to run First Choice approach ('fc') or
Threshold approach ('thres').

\code{data} has to be a data frame including the alternatives that should be
tested

\code{opts} is needed to specify the different alternatives in the
product assortment that should be considered.
Input of \code{opts} has to be column names of variables in \code{data}.

\code{none} to specify column name of the \code{none} alternative in the
validation/holdout task.

\code{size} has to be a whole number determining the size of the assortment.

\code{fixed} has to be a vector of variables that are fixed in the
assortment, i.e., they have to be part of the assortment

\code{prohib} has to be a vector of variables that are prohibited in the
assortment, i.e., alternatives that are not allowed to be together in one
assortment.

\code{approach} character defining whether first
choice \code{approach = 'fc'} or threshold \code{approach = 'thres'}.
If \code{approach = 'fc'}, participants are considered being reached, if
there alternative with highest utility is included in the assortment
(Chrzan & Orme, 2019, p. 111).
 On the contrary, if \code{approach = 'thres'}, participants are considered
 being reached, if utility of one product is higher than the one of
 the \code{none} alternative (Chrzan & Orme, 2019, p. 112).
 If \code{approach = 'fc'}, \code{reach} equals \code{freq} since
 participants have at maximum their most preferred alternative that
 exceeds the \code{none} alternative.}

\description{
T(otal) U(nduplicated) R(each) and F(requency) is
a "product line extension model" (Miaoulis et al., 1990, p. 29). For each
possible combinations, it looks for the reach and frequency of this
combination. Participants are reached, if at least one of the alternatives
in a combination has a higher utility than \code{none}. On the contrary,
frequency calculates the averaged number of alternatives that have a
higher utility than \code{none}.
