\description{
T(otal) U(nduplicated) R(each) and F(requency) is a "product line extension
model" (Miaoulis et al., 1990, p. 29). For each possible combination,
\code{turf()} looks for the reach and frequency of this combination. Participants
are reached, if at least one of the alternatives in a combination has a
higher utility than \code{none}. On the contrary, frequency calculates the
averaged number of alternatives that have a
higher utility than \code{none}.
}
\details{
\code{data} a data frame including the alternatives that should be tested.

\code{opts} to specify the different alternatives in the product assortment that
should be considered. Input of \code{opts} has to be column name of variables
in \code{data}.

\code{none} to specify column name of the \code{none} alternative in \code{data}
that needs to be exceeded.

\code{size} an integer to determine the size of the assortment.

\code{fixed} has to be a vector of variables that are fixed in the
assortment, i.e., they have to be part of the assortment.

\code{prohib} has to be a list of vectors of variables that are prohibited
in the assortment, i.e., alternatives that are not allowed to be together in
one assortment.

\code{approach} character defining whether first choice \code{approach = 'fc'} or
threshold \code{approach = 'thres'} should be applied for running \code{turf()}. If
\code{approach = 'fc'}, participants are considered being reached, if their
alternative with the highest utility is included in the assortment and this
alternative's utility is larger than the threshold's utility (Chrzan & Orme,
2019, p. 111).
On the contrary, if \code{approach = 'thres'}, participants are considered
being reached, if utility of one product is higher than the one of the
\code{none} alternative (Chrzan & Orme, 2019, p. 112).
If \code{approach = 'fc'}, \code{reach} equals \code{freq} since participants have at
maximum their most preferred alternative that exceeds the \code{none}
alternative.
