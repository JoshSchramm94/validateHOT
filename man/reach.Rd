\description{
Reach function of T(otal) U(nduplicated) R(each) and F(requency)
analysis to measure the number of  the averaged percentage of how
many participants you can reach (at least one of the products resemble
a purchase option) is reached with a specific product bundle assortment.
}
\details{
\code{reach} calculates the the percentage of consumers that are
reached with a particular product assortment. The current
logic of \code{reach} is that the utility of an alternative has to
exceed a threshold. In the case of \code{reach} this threshold is referred
to the \code{none} argument in \code{data}, however, could also be, e.g., a
current product.


\code{data} has to be a data frame including the alternatives that
should be tested.

\code{group} optional grouping variable, if results should be displayed
by different groups. Has to be column name of variables in \code{data}.

\code{opts} specifies the different alternatives in the
product assortment that should be considered.
Input of \code{opts} has to be column names of variables in \code{data}.

\code{none} to specify column name of the \code{none} alternative (i.e.,
threshold variable).
