\description{
\code{reach()} of T(otal) U(nduplicated) R(each) and F(requency)
analysis to measure the number of  the averaged percentage of how
many participants you can reach (at least one of the products resemble
a purchase option) is reached with a specific product bundle assortment.
}
\details{
\code{reach()} calculates the the percentage of consumers that are
reached with a particular product assortment. The current
logic of \code{reach()} is that the utility of an alternative has to
exceed a threshold. In the case of \code{reach()} this threshold is referred
to the \code{none} argument in \code{data}, however, could also be, e.g., a
current product.

\code{data} a data.frame object including the alternatives that should
be tested.

\code{group} optional grouping variable, if results should be displayed
by different groups. Has to be column name of variables in \code{data}.

\code{opts} defines product assortment that should be considered.
Input of \code{opts} has to be column names of variables in \code{data}.

\code{none} to specify column name of the \code{none} alternative (i.e.,
threshold variable).
