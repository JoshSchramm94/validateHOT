demand}
\usage{
precision(data, group, opts, choice, none)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with all relevant variables.}

\item{group}{Optional column name(s) to specify grouping variable(s)
to get `precision()` by group(s).}

\item{opts}{Column names of the alternatives included in the
validation/holdout task.}

\item{choice}{Column name of the actual choice in the validation/holdout
task.}

\item{none}{Column name of none alternative.}
}
\value{
a tibble
}
\description{
`precision` is one of the 5 metrics of the confusion matrix
and is defined as \eqn{\frac{TP}{TP + FP}}, where TP =
True Positives, FP = False Positives (see, e.g., Burger, 2018).
}
\details{
The current logic of `precision()` is to determine whether a binary coded
choice is correctly predicted by the model. To use the function, the
validation/holdout task must include a `none` alternative.
One possible application is, for example, whether a buy or a no-buy choice
has been correctly predicted. For example, suppose you have three
alternatives plus a `none` alternative and want to check whether a buy
or no-buy was correctly predicted. This function can be useful if you, for
example, test whether your model significantly overestimates or
underestimates a purchase likelihood.

`data` has to be a data frame including the alternatives shown in
the validation/holdout task. Can be created using the `createHOT()`
function.

`group` optional grouping variable, if results should be display by
different conditions. Has to be column name of variables in `data`.

`opts` is required to specify the different alternatives in the
validation/holdout task (also includes the `none` alternative).
Input of `opts` has to be column names of variables in `data`.

`choice` to specify column of actual choice in the validation/holdout
task. Input of `choice` has to be column name of actual choice.

`none` is required to specify column name of the `none`
alternative in the validation/holdout task.

Please be aware about the following 2x2 table regarding coding of buy and
no-buy choice:

\tabular{crcc}{
   \tab \tab  Predicted           \tab    \cr
Observed \tab \tab  Buy \tab No-Buy  \cr
 \tab Buy \tab A \tab B  \cr
 \tab No-Buy \tab C \tab D  \cr
}
}
\examples{

library(validateHOT)

HOT <- createHOT(
  data = MaxDiff,
  id = 1,
  none = 19,
  prod.levels = list(3, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18),
  method = "MaxDiff",
  choice = 20, varskeep = 21
)

# precision - without group argument defined
precision(
  data = HOT,
  opts = c(Option_1:None),
  choice = choice,
  none = None
)

# precision - with group argument defined
precision(
  data = HOT,
  opts = c(Option_1:None),
  choice = choice,
  none = None,
  group = Group
)
